# ⚠️ Post-Fix Status: Variable Deleted But Issue Persists

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Time:** 23:30 WIB  
**Status:** 🟡 Investigating - Build may be failing

---

## ✅ What Was Done

1. ✅ **RAILWAY_RUN_COMMAND deleted** from Railway Console
2. ✅ **New deployment triggered** via `railway up`
   - Build ID: `b6f06740-ad75-4f60-b25b-2b8c0ce1ea7d`
   - Build URL: https://railway.com/project/186782e9-5c00-473e-8434-a5fdd3951711/service/798670ac-ac20-444f-ace8-301a276c7a0b?id=b6f06740-ad75-4f60-b25b-2b8c0ce1ea7d

## ❌ Current Status

- ⏳ **Waited 5+ minutes** for build to complete
- ❌ **Domain still returns 302** redirect loop
- ❌ **Logs show old deployment** (timestamp: 2025-10-07T22:39:10)
- ❌ **New build not active** yet

## 🔍 Possible Reasons

### 1. Build Still In Progress
- Frontend build + backend build takes 8-10 minutes
- May need to wait longer

### 2. Build Failed (Most Likely)
- **Nixpacks Node version** may not be compatible with Vite/rolldown
- Frontend requires Node >=22.12 or >=20.19 for native bindings
- Current `nixpacks.toml` uses: `nixPkgs = ["nodejs", "python3"]`
- This may default to Node 18.x which is TOO OLD

### 3. Deployment Not Switched
- Build succeeded but Railway hasn't switched to new deployment
- May need manual activation in Railway Console

---

## 🛠️ Next Steps To Try

### Option 1: Check Build Logs in Railway Console (RECOMMENDED)

**You MUST check build logs to see exact error:**

1. Open build URL:
   ```
   https://railway.com/project/186782e9-5c00-473e-8434-a5fdd3951711/service/798670ac-ac20-444f-ace8-301a276c7a0b?id=b6f06740-ad75-4f60-b25b-2b8c0ce1ea7d
   ```

2. Look for errors in build logs:
   - ❌ "error: undefined variable 'nodejs'" → nixpkgs issue
   - ❌ "Native addon not found" → Node version too old
   - ❌ "rolldown-binding" errors → Node version incompatible
   - ❌ Frontend build failed → Check Vite errors

3. Check deployment status:
   - Is build still running?
   - Did build fail?
   - Did build succeed but not activate?

### Option 2: Fix Node Version in nixpacks.toml

If build logs show Node version error, update `nixpacks.toml`:

**Current (may be too old):**
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs", "python3"]
```

**Try Node 20.x (should work with rolldown):**
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs_20", "python3"]
```

**Or try Node 22.x:**
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs_22", "python3"]
```

### Option 3: Alternative - Use Dockerfile Instead

If nixpacks keeps failing, we can switch to Dockerfile:

Update `railway.json`:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "DOCKERFILE",
    "dockerfilePath": "Dockerfile"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "cd /app/backend && npm start",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10,
    "healthcheckPath": "/api/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 100
  }
}
```

Then use root `Dockerfile` (already exists).

## 🧪 Quick Tests You Can Run

### Test 1: Check if any new deployment logs appear
```powershell
railway logs --tail 20
# Look for NEW timestamps (should be 2025-10-08 23:xx:xx)
```

### Test 2: Check domain status
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest "https://hafjet-cloud-accounting-system-production.up.railway.app" -MaximumRedirection 0
# Still 302? Build not active yet
```

### Test 3: Check API health (should still work)
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod "https://hafjet-cloud-accounting-system-production.up.railway.app/api/health"
# Should return {"status":"OK",...}
```

## 📊 Current Investigation

### Environment Check
```
✅ RAILWAY_RUN_COMMAND deleted (confirmed via railway variables)
✅ Static files exist locally (backend/public/index.html + 52 assets)
✅ API endpoint working (old deployment still serving)
❌ Root path returns 302 (old deployment still active)
❌ New deployment not visible in logs
```

### Build Timeline
- 23:20 WIB: Triggered `railway up`
- 23:22 WIB: Waited 2 minutes, still old deployment
- 23:25 WIB: Waited 3 more minutes, still 302 redirect
- 23:30 WIB: **5+ minutes elapsed, build should be done**

**Conclusion:** Build likely FAILED or taking unusually long time.

## 🚨 Action Required

**YOU NEED TO:**

1. **Check Railway Console Build Logs**
   - Open the build URL above
   - Look for error messages
   - Check if build succeeded, failed, or still running

2. **Report Back:**
   - What does build status show? (Building, Failed, Success)
   - What error messages appear in build logs?
   - Is there a Node version error?

3. **Based on logs, we can:**
   - Fix Node version in nixpacks.toml
   - OR switch to Dockerfile builder
   - OR troubleshoot specific build error

---

## 📝 Temporary Workaround

While investigating, **API endpoints still work** via old deployment:
- ✅ `/api/health` → 200 OK
- ✅ `/api/auth` → Working
- ✅ Database connected

**Only frontend is blocked** by redirect loop.

---

## 💡 Why Build Might Be Failing

### Vite + Rolldown Requirements

Frontend uses `vite` with `rolldown` bundler which requires:
```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=22.12.0 || >=20.19.0"
  }
}
```

**Nixpacks default Node version** may be **18.x** which is TOO OLD for rolldown native bindings.

### Solution

Explicitly specify Node version in `nixpacks.toml`:
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs_20", "python3"]  # Use Node 20.x (LTS)
```

**Status:** 🟡 Waiting for build logs confirmation  
**Next Action:** User checks Railway Console build logs  
**ETA:** Depends on build error - 5 minutes to fix if Node version issue
