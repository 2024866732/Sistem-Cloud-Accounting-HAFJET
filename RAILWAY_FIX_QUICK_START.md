# üöÄ Quick Setup Guide - Fix Railway Deployment

## ‚ö° TL;DR - What You Need to Do

Your Railway deployment is now fixed! The workflow no longer requires `RAILWAY_SERVICE` secret. Here's what to do:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Verify RAILWAY_TOKEN Secret (Required)

Check if you have this secret set:
```bash
gh secret list | grep RAILWAY_TOKEN
```

If not found, get your Railway token:
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Open your project
3. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Tokens** ‚Üí **Create Service Token**
4. Copy the token and add it:

```bash
gh secret set RAILWAY_TOKEN --body "your-token-here"
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ (Optional) Add RAILWAY_PROJECT Secret

This helps Railway CLI know which project to deploy to:

```bash
# Find your project ID from Railway dashboard URL:
# https://railway.app/project/YOUR-PROJECT-ID-HERE

gh secret set RAILWAY_PROJECT --body "your-project-id"
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ (Optional) Add RAILWAY_BACKEND_URL Secret

After your first successful deployment, get the URL from Railway and add it:

```bash
gh secret set RAILWAY_BACKEND_URL --body "https://your-app.railway.app"
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Test the Deployment

Push to main branch or trigger manually:

```bash
# Option 1: Push a change
git commit --allow-empty -m "test: trigger Railway deployment"
git push

# Option 2: Trigger manually from GitHub
# Go to: Actions ‚Üí CI/CD Deploy to Railway ‚Üí Run workflow
```

## üìä What Changed

### Before ‚ùå
```yaml
# Required RAILWAY_SERVICE secret
railway up --service "$RAILWAY_SERVICE"
```
- ‚ùå Required exact service name
- ‚ùå Failed if service name was wrong
- ‚ùå Hard to configure

### After ‚úÖ
```yaml
# Auto-detects service from project
railway up --detach
```
- ‚úÖ No service name needed
- ‚úÖ Auto-detects from railway.json
- ‚úÖ Multiple fallback methods
- ‚úÖ Better error messages

## üîç Verify Your Configuration

### Check Required Files Exist

```bash
# These files configure Railway deployment
ls -la railway.json nixpacks.toml

# Should output:
# railway.json    ‚úÖ
# nixpacks.toml   ‚úÖ
```

### Check GitHub Secrets

```bash
gh secret list

# Should show at least:
# RAILWAY_TOKEN   ‚úÖ

# Optionally:
# RAILWAY_PROJECT ‚ö†Ô∏è (recommended)
# RAILWAY_BACKEND_URL ‚ö†Ô∏è (for health checks)
```

## üéØ Expected Results

### Successful Deployment
```
üöÄ Starting Railway deployment...
‚úÖ Deployment succeeded using 'railway up --detach'
‚úÖ Deployment Complete
```

### Optional Health Check (if RAILWAY_BACKEND_URL is set)
```
üè• Running health checks against: https://your-app.railway.app/api/health
‚úÖ Health check passed!
```

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still getting "Service not found"

**This should not happen anymore!** But if it does:

1. Verify RAILWAY_TOKEN is valid:
   ```bash
   # Test locally
   railway login
   railway status
   ```

2. Check if railway.json exists:
   ```bash
   cat railway.json
   ```

3. Try linking project manually:
   ```bash
   railway link YOUR-PROJECT-ID
   ```

### Issue: Deployment succeeds but app doesn't work

1. Check Railway logs:
   ```bash
   railway logs --tail 100
   ```

2. Verify environment variables in Railway dashboard:
   - Go to your Railway project
   - Click on your service
   - Check Variables tab

3. Check if the health endpoint works:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/health
   ```

### Issue: Health check fails

**This is OK!** Health check is optional. Your deployment can still be successful.

To enable health checks:
1. Get your backend URL from Railway dashboard
2. Add it as a GitHub secret:
   ```bash
   gh secret set RAILWAY_BACKEND_URL --body "https://your-app.railway.app"
   ```
