# Deployment Fix Applied - October 8, 2025

## ‚úÖ Changes Applied (Commit: 23b8134)

### 1. **Frontend package.json** - Moved Vite to dependencies
```json
"dependencies": {
  // ... existing deps
  "vite": "npm:rolldown-vite@7.1.12",
  "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^5.0.3"
}
```

**Why**: Vite must be available during production builds. Previously it was only in `devDependencies` and was being omitted during build steps.

---

### 2. **Root package.json** - Added Node engine constraint
```json
"engines": {
  "node": "20.x"
}
```

**Why**: Dependencies require Node `^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0`. Railway was using Node 22.11.0 which is below 22.12.0. Node 20.x is stable and compatible.

---

### 3. **nixpacks.toml** - Fixed Vite build path and Node version
```toml
[variables]
NODE_ENV = "production"
NIXPACKS_NODE_VERSION = "20"

[phases.build]
cmds = [
  # FIXED: Use ./node_modules/.bin/vite instead of ../node_modules/.bin/vite
  "cd /app/frontend && ./node_modules/.bin/vite build || npm run build",
  "cd /app/backend && npm run build",
  "mkdir -p /app/backend/public",
  "cp -r /app/frontend/dist/* /app/backend/public/ || true"
]
```

**Why**: 
- Previous path `../node_modules/.bin/vite` was incorrect - Vite is installed in `/app/frontend/node_modules`, not parent
- `NIXPACKS_NODE_VERSION = "20"` forces Nixpacks to use Node 20.x

## üöÄ Deployment Status

**Build ID**: `a338e371-fc66-4b40-8b7f-389370ab635e`

**Build URL**: https://railway.com/project/186782e9-5c00-473e-8434-a5fdd3951711/service/798670ac-ac20-444f-ace8-301a276c7a0b?id=a338e371-fc66-4b40-8b7f-389370ab635e

**Git Commit**: `18eef12` (pushed to main)

## üîç What to Verify in Railway Console

Open the build URL above and check for these success indicators:

### ‚úì Phase 1: Setup
- [ ] `Nixpacks v1.38.0` or similar
- [ ] Node version shows: `nodejs-20.x.x` (NOT 22.11.0)

### ‚úì Phase 2: Install
- [ ] Root install: `npm ci --omit=dev --legacy-peer-deps` (success)
- [ ] Frontend install: `cd /app/frontend && npm ci --include=dev --legacy-peer-deps` 
  - Should show: "added XXX packages" (including vite)
- [ ] Backend install: `cd /app/backend && npm ci --include=dev --legacy-peer-deps`
  - Should show: "added XXX packages"

### ‚úì Phase 3: Build
- [ ] Frontend build: `cd /app/frontend && ./node_modules/.bin/vite build`
  - Should NOT show: "vite: not found"
  - Should show: "‚úì built in XXXms" with output to `dist/`
- [ ] Backend build: `cd /app/backend && npm run build` (success)
- [ ] Copy assets: `cp -r /app/frontend/dist/* /app/backend/public/`
  - No errors

### ‚úì Phase 4: Deployment
- [ ] Container starts successfully
- [ ] Health check passes at `/api/health`
- [ ] Domain shows HTTP 200 (not 302 redirect loop)

---

## üß™ Testing After Deployment

Once the build completes and activates, test these:

### 1. Root Path Test
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://hafjet-cloud-accounting-system-production.up.railway.app/" -Method Head -MaximumRedirection 0
```
**Expected**: 
- Status: `200 OK`
- Content-Type: `text/html`

**NOT Expected**:
- Status: `302 Found` (redirect loop)
- Status: `404 Not Found`

### 2. API Health Check
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://hafjet-cloud-accounting-system-production.up.railway.app/api/health"
```
**Expected**: 
- Status: `200 OK`
- Response: `{"status":"ok"}`

### 3. Static Assets Test
Open in browser: https://hafjet-cloud-accounting-system-production.up.railway.app/

**Expected**:
- Frontend loads (React app)
- Assets load from `/assets/` path
- No console errors for missing files
- Login/dashboard interface visible

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è If Build Still Fails

### Issue: "vite: not found" persists
**Check**:
1. Frontend install logs show `vite` was installed
2. Build command uses `./node_modules/.bin/vite` (not `../node_modules`)
3. `frontend/package.json` has `vite` in dependencies

**Fix**: Verify `frontend/package.json` was pushed correctly:
```bash
git show HEAD:frontend/package.json | grep -A 2 '"vite"'
```

### Issue: Wrong Node version
**Check**: Build logs show Node 20.x, not 22.11.0

**Fix**: 
- Verify `NIXPACKS_NODE_VERSION = "20"` in `nixpacks.toml`
- Clear Railway cache and rebuild

### Issue: EBADENGINE warnings
If packages still complain about Node version:
- Check if Node 20.19.0+ is actually installed (Railway may not have exact 20.19.0)
- Consider pinning to specific Node version like `20.19.0` instead of `20.x`

---

## üìä Current Status (as of deployment trigger)

- ‚úÖ Code changes committed and pushed
- ‚úÖ Railway build triggered
- ‚è≥ Build in progress (check URL above)
- ‚è≥ Waiting for deployment activation
- ‚è≥ Domain still showing 302 (old deployment active)

**Next Steps**:
1. Open the build URL in Railway Console
2. Monitor the build logs for the checklist items above
3. Once build completes, test the domain
4. If 200 OK ‚Üí SUCCESS! üéâ
5. If still errors ‚Üí share the final build log tail (last 50 lines)

---

## üéØ Expected Outcome

After successful build and deployment:
- ‚úÖ Frontend builds with Vite successfully
- ‚úÖ Static assets copied to `backend/public/`
- ‚úÖ Root domain returns HTTP 200 with HTML
- ‚úÖ No redirect loop
- ‚úÖ React app loads in browser
- ‚úÖ API endpoints work at `/api/*`

---

## üìù Summary

**Root Cause**: 
1. Vite was in devDependencies but not available during build
2. Wrong Node version (22.11.0 vs required 20.19+/22.12+)
3. Incorrect Vite binary path in build command

**Solution Applied**:
1. ‚úÖ Moved Vite to dependencies
2. ‚úÖ Pinned Node to 20.x
3. ‚úÖ Fixed Vite path from `../node_modules` to `./node_modules`

**Commit**: `23b8134` - "fix(build): move Vite to dependencies, pin Node 20, fix build path"
