# Loyverse POS Integration Guide (HAFJET Cloud Accounting)

## Overview
This module enables secure two-way sync between HAFJET Cloud Accounting and Loyverse POS. All sales, inventory, products, and customers stay in sync for accurate accounting and reporting.

## Features
- OAuth2 authentication (secure connect)
- Scheduled/manual sync of sales, products, inventory, customers
- Two-way sync: Pull from Loyverse, push invoices/payments/stock if required
- Error handling, deduplication, incremental updates
- UI for setup, sync status/log, manual trigger
- Automated integration tests

## Setup Steps
1. Configure OAuth2 credentials in environment variables (`LOYVERSE_CLIENT_ID`, `LOYVERSE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `LOYVERSE_REDIRECT_URI`).
2. Use `LoyverseSyncService` in backend to authenticate and pull/push data.
3. Schedule `runLoyverseSyncJob` via cron or webhook for regular sync.
4. Use React UI (`LoyverseIntegration.tsx`) for OAuth setup, sync status/log, and manual trigger.
5. Extend mapping logic for business needs.

## API Reference
See [backend/src/integrations/loyverse/loyverseApiDocs.md](../backend/src/integrations/loyverse/loyverseApiDocs.md) for endpoint and data model details.

## Testing
- Run integration tests: `vitest backend/src/integrations/loyverse/loyverseSyncService.test.ts`

## Maintenance
- All code is commented and documented for future extensibility.
- UI and backend modules are decoupled for easy updates.
