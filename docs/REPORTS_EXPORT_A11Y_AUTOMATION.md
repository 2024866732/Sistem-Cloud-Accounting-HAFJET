# Reports Export Flow & Accessibility Automation

## Export Flow
- The Reports page uses the `ReportExport` component for exporting reports in PDF, Excel, or CSV format.
- The export logic calls the backend endpoint (`/api/reports/export?type={reportType}&format={format}`) and triggers a file download.
- Export status is updated for accessibility (aria-live region) and user feedback.

## Accessibility Automation
- All interactive elements (buttons, selects) have visible text or aria-labels.
- Color scheme uses CSS theme variables for WCAG AA+ contrast.
- Playwright E2E tests run axe-core accessibility checks before and after export.
- Export status is exposed via an aria-live region for screen readers.

## Visual Regression
- Playwright visual regression test captures a screenshot after export and compares to baseline.
- Accessibility overlays are excluded from visual diff.

## Reusable Components
- `ReportExport`: Handles export logic, status updates, and backend integration.
- All UI components refactored to use theme variables for maintainability and compliance.

## How to Run Automation
- Run Playwright E2E tests: `npx playwright test e2e/export.spec.ts e2e/reports.visual.spec.ts`
- All accessibility and visual checks are automated in CI.
