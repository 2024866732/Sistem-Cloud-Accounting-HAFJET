## ⚠️ ONE MANUAL ACTION REQUIRED

### Issue: Railway Service Not Found
**Error:** `Service '***' not found`

**Root Cause:** The `RAILWAY_SERVICE` GitHub secret is either:
- Not set
- Set to incorrect service name
- Service doesn't exist in Railway project

### Solution: Set Correct RAILWAY_SERVICE Secret

#### Step 1: Get Your Service Name
```bash
# Login to Railway
railway login

# List available services
railway service
```

Example output:
```
✓ Service: hafjet-backend
✓ Service: hafjet-frontend
✓ Service: hafjet-database
```

#### Step 2: Set GitHub Secret
1. Go to: https://github.com/2024866732/Sistem-Cloud-Accounting-HAFJET/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click **"New repository secret"**
3. **Name:** `RAILWAY_SERVICE`
4. **Value:** (exact service name from Step 1, e.g., `hafjet-backend`)
5. Click **"Add secret"**

#### Step 3: Verify Secret is Set
Check that you have these secrets:
- ✅ `RAILWAY_TOKEN`
- ✅ `RAILWAY_PROJECT`  
- ⚠️ `RAILWAY_SERVICE` ← **SET THIS NOW**

#### Step 4: Trigger Deployment
```bash
# Option 1: Empty commit to trigger workflow
git commit --allow-empty -m "trigger: test Railway deployment with correct service"
git push

# Option 2: Manual trigger from GitHub Actions UI
# Go to: Actions → CI/CD Deploy to Railway → Run workflow
```

✅ Frontend build success
✅ Backend build success  
✅ Railway CLI connects to service
✅ Deployment succeeds: railway up --service "$RAILWAY_SERVICE"
✅ Health check passes
✅ Application live on Railway URL
```
