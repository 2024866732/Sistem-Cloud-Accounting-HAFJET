# Railway Deployment Fix - Service Auto-Detection

## üéØ Issue Fixed

**Problem:** Railway deployment was failing with error:
```
Service '***' not found
```

**Root Cause:** The workflow required a `RAILWAY_SERVICE` secret that was either:
- Not configured in GitHub repository
- Set to an incorrect or non-existent service name
- Not matching the actual Railway service name

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

The deployment workflow has been updated to use **Railway's auto-detection** feature instead of requiring a hardcoded service name.

### What Changed

#### Before (‚ùå Required RAILWAY_SERVICE)
```bash
railway up --service "$RAILWAY_SERVICE"
```
This required the exact service name to be configured as a GitHub secret.

#### After (‚úÖ Auto-detection)
```bash
# Primary method: Auto-detect from railway.json and nixpacks.toml
railway up --detach

# Fallback methods if primary fails:
railway deploy --detach
railway up --service "$RAILWAY_SERVICE" --detach  # Only if RAILWAY_SERVICE is set
```

### Key Improvements

1. **Service Auto-Detection**: Railway CLI automatically detects services from project configuration files
2. **Multiple Fallback Methods**: Three different deployment approaches for maximum reliability
3. **Optional Configuration**: RAILWAY_SERVICE secret is now optional, not required
4. **Better Error Handling**: Clear error messages with troubleshooting steps
5. **Flexible Health Checks**: Only runs if RAILWAY_BACKEND_URL secret is configured

## üîß Configuration Guide

### Required Secrets (GitHub Repository Settings)

#### 1. RAILWAY_TOKEN (‚úÖ REQUIRED)
Get your Railway token from:
1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app)
2. Open your project
3. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Tokens** ‚Üí **Create Service Token**
4. Copy the token

Add to GitHub:
```bash
# Using GitHub CLI
gh secret set RAILWAY_TOKEN --body "your-token-here"

# Or via GitHub UI:
# Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí New repository secret
```

### Optional Secrets (Recommended for Better Experience)

#### 2. RAILWAY_PROJECT (‚ö†Ô∏è OPTIONAL but recommended)
Your Railway project ID for explicit project linking.

Find your project ID:
```bash
# Login to Railway CLI locally
railway login

# Get project ID
railway status
```

Add to GitHub:
```bash
gh secret set RAILWAY_PROJECT --body "your-project-id"
```

#### 3. RAILWAY_BACKEND_URL (‚ö†Ô∏è OPTIONAL)
Your Railway backend deployment URL for health check validation.

Get the URL from Railway dashboard after first successful deployment:
- Example: `https://your-app.railway.app`

Add to GitHub:
```bash
gh secret set RAILWAY_BACKEND_URL --body "https://your-app.railway.app"
```

#### 4. RAILWAY_SERVICE (‚ö†Ô∏è OPTIONAL)
Only needed if you have multiple services and want to deploy a specific one.

```bash
# List available services
railway service

# Set the secret (if needed)
gh secret set RAILWAY_SERVICE --body "your-service-name"
```

    B --> C{Try railway up --detach}
    C -->|Success| D[Deployment Complete]

    I -->|Yes| J[Run Health Check]
    I -->|No| K[Skip Health Check]
    J --> L[Verify Deployment]
    K --> L
```

### Deployment Methods (In Order)

1. **Primary**: `railway up --detach`
   - Uses railway.json and nixpacks.toml configuration
   - Automatically detects services
   - Best for monorepo or single-service setups

2. **Fallback 1**: `railway deploy --detach`
   - Alternative deployment command
   - Also uses project configuration

3. **Fallback 2**: `railway up --service "$RAILWAY_SERVICE" --detach`
   - Only used if RAILWAY_SERVICE secret is set
   - For specific service targeting

## üè• Health Check Behavior

### With RAILWAY_BACKEND_URL Set
```bash
‚úÖ Runs health check against: $RAILWAY_BACKEND_URL/api/health
‚úÖ Retries 6 times with 10-second intervals
‚úÖ Validates deployment success
```

### Without RAILWAY_BACKEND_URL
```bash
‚ö†Ô∏è Health check skipped
üí° Deployment still succeeds
üí° Verify manually in Railway dashboard
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: "Service not found"
**Solution**: This error should no longer occur with auto-detection. If it does:
1. Verify `railway.json` exists in project root
2. Check `nixpacks.toml` configuration
3. Ensure RAILWAY_TOKEN is valid
4. Try adding RAILWAY_PROJECT secret

#### Issue: "Authentication failed"
**Solution**:
1. Regenerate RAILWAY_TOKEN from Railway dashboard
2. Update GitHub secret
3. Check token has correct permissions

#### Issue: "Deployment succeeds but health check fails"
**Solution**:
1. Check Railway logs for runtime errors
2. Verify backend is listening on correct PORT
3. Ensure `/api/health` endpoint exists
4. Wait longer (service may still be starting)
5. Optional: Skip health check by not setting RAILWAY_BACKEND_URL

#### Issue: "Build succeeds but deployment fails"
**Solution**:
1. Check Railway logs in dashboard
2. Verify environment variables in Railway
3. Check start command in railway.json
4. Verify nixpacks.toml build configuration
